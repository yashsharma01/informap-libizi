          "desc": "Impressionism was a new, rebellious movement in the art of painting in the second half of the nineteenth century. Édouard Manet could be considered the founder of this movement. Lunch on the Grass depicts an outdoor picnic. In the Bois de Boulogne, the best known park in Paris. The company consists of two men, Manet's brother and his brother-in-law, and two women, one of whom is nude. The nude woman sits with the two men, although they seem to be so deep in discussion that they hardly even notice her nakedness at all.\r\n\r\nThe rebellious Manet received a lot of criticism from his peers on the nudity of the woman; they considered it filthy and inappropriate. The painting became a major scandal and even reached the front pages of the Parisian newspapers, making it instantly famous. This painting is considered to be the starting point of modern art by the Musee d’Orsay, where the work is displayed.\r\n",

Nowadays, many people immortalize Escher’s work with tattoos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Relativity\" lithograph is based on an impossible object. You can actually continue to turn it without it ever looking 'upside down'. We see men walking along the stairs, some walking upstairs, some downstairs. Escher thought this out very well and clearly took pleasure in playing with our way of seeing things. In this engraving, he pursues the limits of our logic.\r\n",

In terms of prominence, his work is equal to Picasso's Guernica or Warhol's Campbell's soup cans. But where Guernica is symbolic of the horrors of war, Mondrian's Victory Boogie-Woogie is a triumphant answer to the Second World War, a symbol of joy and freedom. \r\n\r\nAs a big fan of jazz, Mondrian felt right at home in New York. He fled there from Paris, via London at the start of the Second World War. In the fast-paced and lively New York, Mondrian developed a new style in which he explored new compositions and rhythms. Inspired by the city and the introduction of boogie-woogie music, he began work on his last painting.\r\n",

In its time, it was also called The lust or The Strawberry Painting. Some scholars suggest that Bosch represented an orgy of naked people due to his belonging to the sect of the Adamites, a kind of primal religious nudist group.\r\n\r\nThe left panel shows the Garden of Eden, or Paradise, where Adam and Eve linger before they fall from grace. The middle panel shows the human world before the biblical flood of Noah. The right-hand panel then shows hellish scenery; what happens when humankind behave sinfully.\r\n",

This painting depicts his famous melted clocks. The painting is representation of the relativity of time, a subject that is based on Einstein’s theory of relativity, which sparked a lot of interest in the 1920’s.

With his iconic cartoons which, according to some, are erroneously counted as Pop Art, Keith Haring conquered the streets and subways of New York with his graffiti art and murals. Haring believes that art is for everyone, not just for the elite, and makes it his business to bring art to the people. He set up \"The Pop Shop', a shop where, at an affordable price, you can buy his art, whether it be on a mug or a t-shirt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaring’s role model was his good friend, hero and mentor, Andy Warhol, whom he met in 1984 after his second exhibition in New York. This historic meeting gave rise to the artists discovering their mutual shared belief that “Art is for everyone”. They also both loved Disney.\r\n",

The painting was called the Militia Company of District II under the command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq, but the world really knows it better as The Night Watch.\r\nThe painting was nicknamed The Night Watch because in the 18th and 19th centuries, an old layer of varnish covered the painting with a dark layer of dirt, giving it a dark effect.

This is apparent from his use of gold leaf and the fact that his paintings appear to be structured as a mosaic. The Kiss is probably a little more personal to Klimt than it appears at first glance. The woman in the painting is after all his own beloved (although he has more than one). The face of the man kissing her is turned away from the viewer, as if is losing himself in her. She appears to be standing on a mountain or cliff, dotted with wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThe painting was rediscovered and became world-famous during the ‘flower power’ time of the 1960’s and 1970’s. The bed of flowers, the starry sky and the hint of romance was very appealing to the hippies of that era. Posters of The Kiss are still bestsellers at printing companies.\r\n",
